# ffhomepage
This is a pretty basic but functional homepage.

**Bookmarks**
To customize bookmarks open up index.html and head to <div class="bookmarks"> and then you can edit my current bookmarks and add others.

**Wallpaper**
If you want to customize the wallpaper, just replace wallpaper.png with an image of your choice.

# Enjoy!
